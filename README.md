# electron-dielectric
Numerical methods to compute the finite-temperature random phase approximation and Mermin dielectric functions of a uniform electron gas.

# Introduction
The dielectric function is a wave vector and frequency dependent generalization of the macroscopic dielectric constant $\epsilon$ used in theory of linear dielectric media that relates the electric displacement field $\mathbf{D}$ and the electric field $\mathbf{E}$: $\mathbf{D} = \epsilon \mathbf{E}$. It ultimately describes how the electrons in a material respond to some external electromagnetic perturbation or force. The dielectric function is important because it is related to many observable quantities in the linear response regime, like the dynamic structure factor (which is measured in scattering experiments) and the stopping power (which is important in inertial confinement fusion experiments). 

This module computes the quantum mechanical dielectric function for a uniform electron gas using two popular approaches:
1. The random phase approximation (e.g. Johnson, Nilsen, and Cheng, [2012](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevE.86.036410)) and 
2. The Mermin ansatz (Mermin, [1970](https://link.aps.org/doi/10.1103/PhysRevB.1.2362)), which modifies the electron gas dielectric function to more accurately represent electrons in the real material by incorporating an electron-ion collision rate.
